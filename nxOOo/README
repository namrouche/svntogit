To have a listening OOo running at each Jboss startup on your server

1. install OOo
2. deploy nxSkipInstallWizard.oxt
3. deploy nxOOoAutoListen.oxt
4. add a call to ooo.sh in jboss/bin/run.sh (modify the path to soffice accordingly with your installation)

to deploy an extension
<pathOOoInstalled>/program/unopkg add <extension.oxt>

Here are some details on the element you'll find in this directory

patch
-----
contains modification to the basic OOo install (already applied)
- change user directory name not to overlap an existing one (bootstraprc)
- no more FirstInstallWizard (nxSkipInstallWizard.oxt) - alternativelly, every soffice launch can use the undocumented -nofirststartwizard switch
- listen on port 8100 - Only this extension has to be installed on a existing installation (nxOOoAutoListen.oxt)

ooo.sh
-------
Uses Xvfb on display 77
the -auth Xperm loads the file Xperm that has to be reachable

nxOOo.tar.gz (broken)
------------
OOo to be uncompressed 
will create an nxOOo-user directory in home
--> nxOOo/program/soffice
actually broken due to an OOo bug on 'non-installed' deployed versions

create_nxOOo.sh
---------------
For nuxeo admins, create a new deployable OOo instance
Please check OOo original filename

Details on Deploying OOo for Nuxeo5
-----------------------------------

Some Nuxeo5 features require to setup a listening instance of OpenOffice.org on your server.
If no graphical interface is available, a virtual frame buffer such as Xvfb is also required.

<OOoInstallationPath> is the path where the OOo core is installed.

* deploying the plateform independant extension

The extension will setup OOo to always start in listen mode on localhost:8100 as required. The two following methods can be used

- command line:
<pathOOoInstalled>/program/unopkg add nxOOoAutoListen.oxt

- using OOo Gui
menu Tools > Extensions Manager > Add
browse to the nxOOoAutoListen.oxt and select it

if OOo has never been launched for the current user, you may also install the nxSkipInstallWizard.oxt extension.

* Starting OOo at Jboss startup

This is the plateform dependant part. The general procedure is to add the launching command line in the <JBoss>/bin/run.sh

- if a graphical interface is available

linux:
<OOoInstallationPath>/program/soffice -headless -nofirststartwizard
windows:
<OOoInstallationPath>\program\soffice.exe -headless -nofirststartwizard
MacOsX:
XXX to be completed
solaris:
XXX to be completed

The -nofirstwizard switch is to be used if OOo has never been launched for the current user (if nxSkipInstallWizard.oxt has not been installed)
The -headless switch is mandatory when OOo is run has a server tool

- if no graphical interface is available

A virtual frame buffer has to be launched before OOo

For linux a xvfb-like can be used as written in ooo.sh
At each Jboss start, OOo will be launched in listen mode on the display 77
